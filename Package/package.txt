4. Develop a basic graphics package. 
a. Within the package create a abstract class Shape having function print(). 
b. Create two subclasses Two Dimensional and three Dimensional from Shape class . 
c. These two subclasses also should be abstract. 
d. Implement the print method in the subclasses Square, Circle, Cylinder, Cube, to output 
the type and dimension of the shape Also include area and volume methods to calculate 
the area and volume of the concrete shapes 
e. Write a driver program that creates various shapes and put them in an array of Shape 
Use polymorphism to print and calculate the area and volume of objects stored in array.

5. Create three packagesâ€”PersonPack, FlatPack and PFPack.
a. Package PersonPack must contain a class called Person with the following attributes: 
PIDNumber, name, etc. 
i. It must have a reference variable of the type Flat.
ii. It should have a static method displayOwnershiplnfo() that takes as an input 
parameter a variable of PIDNumber and returns void. This method must display 
the information about the classes Person and Flat. 
b. Package FlatPack must contain the class F with following attributes: apartmentName, 
flatNo and noOfBedrooms 
i. It should have method dispFlatlnfo() that displays information of the attributes 
of the class Flat. 
c. Package PFPack must contain a class called PFDemo that has a main method .
i. create objects of the classes Person and Flat and 
ii. invoke the displayOwnershiplnfo() method
