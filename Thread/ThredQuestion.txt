1. Create three threads with different sleep-times from the main thread with following capabilities.
 One thread generates prime numbers in an infinite loop. Supply the sleep time of main 
thread and the sleep time of prime thread from the command line.
 Two more threads T1 and T2 doing any other work also execute simultaneously with 
suitable display information. 
 When prime thread prints 13, after that T1 goes into wait mode. T1 resumes back when 
prime thread prints 79. 
 Threads T1 and T2 should stop executing when the keys ‘1’ and ‘2’ are pressed 
respectively. Prime thread should stop after the ‘ENTER’ key is pressed. Exit of each 
thread must be displayed on the console.

2. Write a program for restaurant. Use Inter Thread Communication.
 When customer places an order then and only then Manager can take the Order or 
generate a bill of an Order. 
 And display the customer order after it place the Order. 
 You have to display minimum three orders of three different customers A, B and C, in 
which customer A is the preferred customer with higher priority.

3. Implement three classes: Storage, Counter, and Printer. 
 The Storage class should store an integer. 
 The Counter class should create a thread that starts counting from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3 ...) and 
stores each value in the Storage class. 
 The Printer class should create a thread that keeps reading the value in the Storage class 
and printing it.
 Write a program that creates an instance of the Storage class and sets up a Counter and 
a Printer object to operate on it. Ensure that each number is printed exactly once, by 
adding suitable synchronization.

4. Create a class ‘Account’ with private data like accountnumber, name, balance and method 
transaction() which handles withdraws and deposits with suitable display messages. 
 Create a thread class ‘Teller’ with private data like name, an object of class Account, 
amount of transaction and transaction code (deposit or withdrawal). 
 Initiate 2 teller transactions for customer A. 
 Also initiate two separate transaction for customer B and customer C. 
 Transactions for one customer must run in synchronization. 
 Transactions for different customers do not interfere with one another
