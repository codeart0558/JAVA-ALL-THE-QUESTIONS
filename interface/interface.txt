3. Develop the Figure application in given steps.
a. Design an interface IFig having the following methods: 
i. public void calcAreaQ; 
ii. public void calcVolumeO; 
iii. It must also have the variable pi of the type double and having a value 3.1428. 
b. Design an abstract class called Figure. 
i. It must have three attributes r. a and v of data type double. 
ii. It has abstract methods: 
1. public abstract void dispAreaQ; 
2. public abstract void dispVolumeO; 
c. Design three classes Cone, Sphere and Cylinder. Each of them, should 
extend the Figure class and implement the IFig interface.
------------ 
d. Write a test program to demonstrate polymorphism
-----------
ClassName Attribute 
Cone --> h, s of the type double 
Sphere ---> 
Cylinder -->     h of the type double

Figure Formulae 
Cone --> Area =(pi*r*s)+(pi*r*r) --> Volume = (pi * r * r * h)/3 
Sphere --> Area = 4 * p * r * r --> Volume = (4 * pj * r * r r) /3 
Cylinder --> Area =(2*pi*r*r)+(2*pi*r*h) --> Volume = pi * r * r * h
